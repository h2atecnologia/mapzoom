# This is the README file for MapZoom. For information in Portuguese please read README-pt_BR

This is the first public release of MapZoom. Following the Free and Open Source software tradition, BrodTec (http://brodtec.com) is releasing it in a very early stage. This project originated from Joice KÃ¤fer's Computer Engineering graduation work. After this proof of concept, the idea is to have MapZoom becoming a Geo-Aware Content Management System. This proof of concept can be accessed online at http://www.mapzoom.com.br

The software you are downloading now is a proof-of-concept, showing it is possible to easily build geo-aware applications using the Google Maps API, HTML, JavScript and PostgreSQL. The file documentos/index_en.html illustrates how this application can be used. If you want further detail you will have to read Joice's graduation work, which is available in a pdf format in the documentos folder. This document also gives some ideas on how to expand MapZoom.

This software is released under a Creative Commons License, available in the LICENSE file. Use it at your own risk.
